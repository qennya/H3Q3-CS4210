[20 points] Complete the Python program (perceptron.py) to train a Single Layer Perceptron and a
Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify optically recognized handwritten digits. The program will use 3,823
training samples (optdigits.tra file) and 1,797 test samples (optdigits.tes file). Read the file
optdigits.names to get detailed information about this dataset, as well as the files optdigits-orig.tra and
optdigits-orig.names to see the original format of the data, and how it was transformed to speed-up the
learning process. You will compare the model performances while varying two hyperparameters,
learning rate and shuffle, checking which combination leads to the best predictions. Update and print
the accuracy of each classifier when it gets higher, together with their hyperparameters.
